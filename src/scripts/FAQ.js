//               <h3> Myths about Narcan</h3>
//               <p>There are many misconceptions about the use and avliability of Narcan also known as Naloxone.</p>
//               <ul>
//               <h3>Myth #1: Naloxone Encourages Addicts to Take More Drugs</h3>
//               <li>
//               Truth: Research has shown that naloxone does not encourage more substance abuse. In fact, if anything, it decreases the use of opiates. When administered, naloxone blocks the effects of opiate drugs and causes an addict to experience withdrawal symptoms.
//               </li>
//               <h3>Myth #2: Naloxone Prevents Addicts from Seeking Treatment</h3>
//               <li>
//               Truth: There is nothing to indicate that naloxone discourages addicts from entering a rehab program. If anything, this is the one drug that can save addicts from certain death and offer them a chance to get professional help. The near-death experience often serves as a catalyst to get clean and sober.
//               </li>
//               <h3>Myth #3: Naloxone is Only Given by Syringe</h3>
//               <li>
//               Truth: Some people have a serious phobia when it comes to using needles. Fortunately, naloxone comes in alternate delivery forms. For example, Evzio is a kind of naloxone auto-injector that painlessly and easily delivers a life-saving dose of the medication. In addition to intramuscular injections, the overdose antidote can also be administered via an intranasal spray. The thing to remember is that the injectable form of naloxone takes effect much quicker than the nasal spray. If the signs and symptoms indicate a life-or-death emergency, giving the medication via syringe is a better option.

//               <h3>Myth #4: Naloxone is Expensive</h3>
//               <li>
//               As with most medications, the price of naloxone depends on where you purchase it. Additionally, most insurance providers will pay for this medication. Even without prescription coverage, naloxone is a relatively inexpensive drug and, even better, there are plenty of community outreach programs currently providing the overdose antidote for free.
//               </li>
//               <h3>Myth #5: Only Doctors Can Prescribe Naloxone</h3>
//               <li>
//               The FDA recently held a meeting to discuss what steps would be needed in order to increase access to naloxone on a national level. Though legal policies vary by state, most are already providing increased access to the medication. Doctors, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants are generally allowed to prescribe naloxone to patients who are at risk of an opiate overdose. What’s more, a variety of community outreach programs now provide access to naloxone.
